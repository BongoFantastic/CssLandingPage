TOP CSS Flexbox final exercise

The author, feeling good about his progress with CSS and flex layouts, finally moves to complete the final assignment in the unit.
"It's been fun" he thinks to himself "but it's time to move on to JS. I can always come back later."
This landing page will implement flex to the n-th degree. Ideally keeping some block display on divs to create the vertical layout
and thus not having to set the body display to a flex column.
